Software Application Requirements for Laser Hair Removal Business (Poland)
Context:
Context:
I operate a small, solo laser hair removal business in Poland. My client base is growing, and I need a software application to automate and organize various aspects of my business, including appointments, finance, marketing, and client communication. My current tools are manual (Excel, Apple Calendar, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, SMS). This application will be exclusively for the business owner's use, with no direct client or vendor access. I am looking for assistance in generating the code/framework or providing a detailed architectural plan and pseudo-code.

Objective:
To create owner-centric software application that automates and streamlines client management, scheduling, finance, marketing, and communication, developed in phases for MacBook, Web, and iOS.

Phased Product Development Roadmap
The product will be developed according to the following roadmap:

Phase 1: Desktop Application (Core Functionality & Local Control)
This phase focuses on building the foundational features for daily operations, primarily for the owner's use on a MacBook. Data will be managed and accessible by this application. AI and Chatbot functionality should be integrated from this phase.

Phase 2: Web Application (Enhanced Owner Accessibility)
Building upon Phase 1, this phase makes the application accessible via a web browser solely for the owner, ensuring remote management capabilities.

Phase 3: Mobile iOS Application (On-the-Go Owner Management & Advanced AI Features)
This phase develops a native iOS application for the owner, providing optimized mobile access and enhancing the AI chatbot functionality for intuitive interaction.

I. Functional Requirements

Search: Allow search of clients by name.

Quick Viewing: Enable quick viewing of a client's entire history and current treatment progress for specific zones.

Digital Checklist (One-off per client):

This list should be populated by the owner during the first visit as a one-off exercise for each client to identify any allergies, health issues, and other relevant medical history. The system must support the ability to add or modify checklist questions dynamically.

Data Migration (Phase 1 Priority):

Ability to import existing client data from CSV.

2. Appointment Management
Manual Booking/Management (Owner Only):

Ability to add, modify, reschedule, and cancel appointments.

Send automated reminders to clients via SMS, email, Instagram message, and Facebook message at:

24 hours before the scheduled appointment.

1 hour before the scheduled appointment.

Client Opt-out: Possibility for the owner to turn off reminders for individual clients if needed.

Automated Post-Care & Follow-up Messages:

Send a message to clients the day after their treatment to check for any adverse reactions.

Send a message approximately one to two weeks after the treatment to validate the effect of the procedure. (These do not vary by treatment area).

Visit Spacing Logic (Critical): The system MUST enforce minimum waiting periods between sequential hair removal sessions for the same treatment zone:

Session 1: Initial session.

Session 2: Minimum 4 weeks after Session 1.

Session 3: Minimum 6 weeks after Session 2.

Session 4: Minimum 8 weeks after Session 3.

Session 5: Minimum 10 weeks after Session 4.

The system should give a warning message if the minimum time since the last session for that zone has not elapsed.

Operating Hours Management:

Standard Hours: Monday-Friday: 10:00-19:00, Saturday: 10:00-14:00, Sunday: Closed.

Configurable Hours: Allow the owner to easily update the start and end times for each day of the week in the future.

Flexible Discount Rate Configuration: Define and change specific discount rates (percentage or fixed amount).

Configurable Promotional Periods: Define specific calendar periods (e.g., holidays, custom periods).

Targeted Audience Categories: Specify client categories for promotions (e.g., students, seniors, new clients, clients who haven't visited in X months, specific treatment areas).

Partnership Program Integration: Support creating and tracking promotions related to partnerships.

Communication Hub (Phase 2 Full Implementation):

Consolidate communication with clients (SMS, email, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger) into a single interface for owner-initiated outbound messages and management of inbound messages.

Allow sending individual messages and bulk messages.

Provide templates for common messages.

5. Product/Service Management
Define services offered, including pricing and estimated duration.

Track inventory of consumables (e.g., gels, disposables) and alert when low.

6. Hardware Management
Equipment Tracking:

Track hardware (laser equipment) maintenance: capture when maintenance was done and when it is due.

Track hardware insurance (if it is insured): capture when insurance was done and when it is due.

Track number of impulses: to enable analysis of hardware depreciation and utilization.

There is only one laser so it has to be a single placeholder, with no need to add new equipment.

Automated Owner Reminders:

Set reminders (via popup window, SMS, and email, and chatbot) for:

Hardware maintenance due (1 month and 2 weeks before due date).

Hardware insurance due (1 month and 2 weeks before due date).

To visit the accountant.

To pay (regular) expenses (e.g. rent due).

To check inventory.

7. Reporting Functionality

Customer Churn and New Customer Report.

Equipment Reports:

Life Cycle of Equipment: Report % of utilization (derived from impulse count).

Zone Popularity: Report zones from most to least popular by number of sessions.

II. Non-Functional Requirements
1. Usability

Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Phase 1: Fully functional on macOS.

Phase 2: Fully functional via web browser (responsive design).

Phase 3: Fully functional as a native iOS application.

Minimalistic Frontend: The frontend across all three phases should be compatible and very minimalistic.

2. Performance
Responsiveness: The application should load quickly and respond promptly to user actions.

Social Media: Instagram, Facebook.

AI/Chatbot: Integration with an AI service for chatbot functionality.

Booking Platform: Booksy (if API allows).

Communication Services: SMS Gateway Service, Email Transactional Service.

6. Technical Requirements

API: Utilize native APIs where possible and available, avoiding custom APIs unless necessary.

AI and Chatbot Integration:

Integrated from Phase 1.

Designed to be future-proof, accounting for potential changes in AI syntax or underlying models.

7. User Management (Phase 2)
User Types:

Privileged User (Admin): Full access, including direct backend access and configuration.

Regular User: Access to all business functionality (client management, appointments, finance, marketing, hardware tracking, reporting) through the application interface.

III. Database Design Principles
The database schema, tables, and implementation must adhere to the following best practices:

1. Normalization (Ideally to at least 3NF)
Atomic Values: All values in columns must be atomic (indivisible).

Eliminate Redundancy: Data should not be needlessly duplicated across tables. Client names (full_name) must NOT be stored in the appointments table; they will be retrieved by joining appointments.client_id with clients.client_id.

Functional Dependencies: Ensure non-key attributes are dependent only on the primary key.

2. Primary and Foreign Keys
Unique Primary Keys: Each table must have a clear, unique primary key (id column). These should be auto-incrementing integers or UUIDs.

Defined Foreign Keys: Foreign key relationships must be explicitly defined and used appropriately to link related data between tables.

Cascading Rules: Consider and define appropriate ON DELETE and ON UPDATE cascading rules for foreign keys.

3. Constraints and Validation
NOT NULL Constraints: Apply to essential fields (e.g., all ids, names, dates, amounts, mandatory contact info).

UNIQUE Constraints: Apply to fields that must be unique: email, phone_number (in clients table), and service_name (in services table).

CHECK Constraints: Apply to enforce data integrity for specific ranges or conditions.

Appropriate Data Types: Define precise data types for all columns (e.g., VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE, TIME, DATETIME, BOOLEAN, INT).

4. Indexing
Primary Keys: Automatically indexed.

Foreign Keys: Create indexes on all foreign key columns to optimize join operations.

Frequently Queried Columns: Create indexes on columns commonly used.

5. Performance and Scalability Considerations
Database Choice: Select a robust yet easily maintainable database system.
