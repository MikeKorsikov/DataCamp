Revised Software Application Requirements and Project Structure for Laser Hair Removal Business (Poland)

Overview

The revised requirements streamline the original specifications for a solo-operated laser hair removal business in Poland, prioritizing simplicity for a single user while maintaining core functionality for client management, appointment scheduling, finance, marketing, communication, and hardware tracking. The application will be developed in three phases (Desktop, Web, iOS) with a focus on ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and compliance with GDPR and Polish tax regulations. Below are the revised requirements and a proposed project structure for Phase 1 (Desktop), with scalability for future phases.



Revised Phased Product Development Roadmap

The application will be developed in three phases, each building on the previous one, tailored for a solo operator:





Phase 1: Desktop Application (Core Functionality, Local Control)
A macOS desktop application with essential features for daily operations, using local storage (SQLite) and minimalistic UI. Includes basic automation (e.g., reminders, visit spacing logic) and manual communication (SMS/email).



Phase 2: Web Application (Remote Access)
A web-based application for remote access, migrating data to a cloud database (PostgreSQL on Azure) and adding social media integration and advanced reporting.



Phase 3: iOS Application (Mobile Access, Enhanced AI)
A native iOS app for on-the-go management, with push notifications and enhanced AI chatbot functionality for owner assistance.



I. Revised Functional Requirements

1. Client Management





Client Database:





Add, modify, and deactivate clients. Deactivated clients’ history is retained.



Store: full_name (text), phone_number (text), email (text), dob (date), is_blacklisted (boolean, default False), is_active (boolean, default True), notes (text, optional for special instructions).



Search clients by name.



Quick view of client’s treatment history and progress per treatment area.



Digital Checklist:





One-off per client, completed during first visit. Store up to 10 customizable questions (e.g., allergies, medical history) in a JSON field.



Data Migration (Phase 1 Priority):





Import client data from CSV with mandatory fields: full_name, phone_number, email, dob. Optional: notes, treatment history (area_name, visit_number, date, power, amount). Validate data during import (e.g., valid email, date format).

2. Appointment Management





Manual Booking/Management (Owner Only):





Add, modify, reschedule, cancel appointments.



Calendar view (daily, weekly, monthly) for appointments.



Automated Appointment Reminders:





Send reminders via SMS/email 24 hours and 1 hour before appointments.



Allow owner to disable reminders per client.



Automated Post-Care & Follow-Up Messages:





Send post-treatment message 1 day after appointment (check for adverse reactions).



Send follow-up message 1-2 weeks after treatment (validate procedure effect).



Visit Spacing Logic (Critical):





Enforce minimum waiting periods for same treatment area:





Session 2: 4 weeks after Session 1.



Session 3: 6 weeks after Session 2.



Session 4: 8 weeks after Session 3.



Session 5: 10 weeks after Session 4.



Session 6: 12 weeks after Session 5.



Session 7: 14 weeks after Session 6.



Session 8: 16 weeks after Session 7.



Session 9: 18 weeks after Session 8.



Session 10: 20 weeks after Session 9.



Display warning if minimum time not elapsed.



Operating Hours Management:





Default: Monday-Friday 10:00-19:00, Saturday 10:00-14:00, Sunday closed.



Allow owner to update start/end times per day or mark specific dates as closed (e.g., holidays).



Validate no existing appointments conflict with changes.

3. Finance Management





Sales Recording:





Record for each appointment: service, price, payment method (Cash, Card, Phone (NFC), Blik, Bank Transfer).



Expense Tracking:





Record expenses under categories (e.g., Rent, Marketing, Supplies).



Allow custom categories and mark as tax_deductible (boolean).



No outstanding payment or invoicing tracking.

4. Marketing & Communication





Manual Messaging (Phase 1):





Send SMS/email to individual clients or groups using templates (e.g., reminders, promotions).



Automated Messaging (Phase 2):





Send birthday, anniversary (first visit), and Poland state holiday messages.



Manage promotions: loyalty discounts (e.g., 50% on 10th visit), referral discounts, bulk purchase offers.



Define discount rates (percentage/fixed) and promotional periods.



Target specific client groups (e.g., new clients, students).



Communication Hub (Phase 2):





Consolidate SMS, email, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger for outbound and inbound messages.

5. Product/Service Management





Services: Define services (e.g., Laser Hair Removal) with name, price, and duration.



Inventory:





Track consumables (e.g., gels, disposables) with item_name, current_quantity, unit (e.g., ml, pcs), low_stock_threshold (default 10).



Manual quantity updates via UI form.



Low-stock alerts via popup (Phase 1), email/SMS (Phase 2).

6. Hardware Management





Equipment Tracking:





Single laser machine with: equipment_name, purchase_date, last_maintenance_date, next_maintenance_due_date, last_insurance_date, next_insurance_due_date, maximum_impulses_on_purchase, total_impulses_recorded.



Manual entry for impulse counts with validation (total_impulses <= maximum_impulses).



Automated Reminders:





Popup notifications for maintenance (1 month, 2 weeks before due), insurance (1 month, 2 weeks before due), accountant visits, regular expenses (e.g., rent), and inventory checks.

7. Reporting Functionality (Phase 1 Simplified)





Financial Reports:





Monthly revenue, expenses, profit/loss (tables, bar charts).



Export reports to CSV.



Customer Reports:





Client treatment progress (visit number per area).



New clients and churn.



Equipment Reports:





Utilization (% of impulses used).



Zone Reports:





Popularity by session count.



Deferred to Phase 2: Waterfall charts, revenue/profit forecasts, detailed tax calculations.



II. Revised Non-Functional Requirements





Usability:





Intuitive, minimalistic UI in English.



Cross-platform: macOS (Phase 1), web browsers (Phase 2), iOS (Phase 3).



Performance:





Fast loading and responsive UI.



Handle up to 1,000 clients and 10,000 appointments efficiently (suitable for solo operator).



Security (Phase 1 Simplified, Phase 2 Full):





Phase 1: Local data encryption (SQLite with SQLCipher), strong password hashing (bcrypt).



Phase 2: GDPR compliance, SSL/TLS, role-based access (single admin user).



Reliability:





High uptime with local backups (Phase 1). Cloud backups (Phase 2).



Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages.



Integrations (Phase 1 Simplified):





Calendar: Google/Apple Calendar sync.



Communication: Twilio (SMS), SMTP (email).



Deferred to Phase 2: Instagram, Facebook, Booksy (if API available).



Chatbot: Rule-based (Phase 1), AI-enhanced (Phase 3).



Technical Requirements:





Backend: Python, SQLite (Phase 1), PostgreSQL (Phase 2).



Frontend: PyQt (Phase 1), Flask/Bootstrap (Phase 2), SwiftUI (Phase 3).



Hosting: Local (Phase 1), Azure (Phase 2).



III. Revised Database Design Principles





Normalization: 3NF with atomic values, no redundancy (e.g., client names not stored in appointments).



Keys: Auto-incrementing integer primary keys, defined foreign keys with ON DELETE/UPDATE CASCADE.



Constraints: NOT NULL for essential fields, CHECK for valid ranges (e.g., positive amounts).



Indexing: On primary/foreign keys and frequently queried columns (e.g., client name).



Database: SQLite (Phase 1), PostgreSQL (Phase 2).
